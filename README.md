#SAMURA.P.I.

## About
SamurA.P.I. is an app for all those who are interested in the way of the samurai and can learn more about the philosophy about the great Japanese warriors. This little turf on the internet provides information about 'Bushido', the philosophy and the code of conduct the samurai devoted themselves to uphold in their lives and to share various media where people can discover more about this code, making the audience demographic a niche but fiercly curious about philosophy.

## Project Narrative
#### Day 1 & Day 2
The initial idea was to create a horizontally scrolling website that was inspired by this [website](http://exponius.sutueatsflies.com/).
It would have various characters popping up as the user scrolled to the right, having a story unfold.

As time was rnning out, it would've been easier to use a theme that has been established before instead of creating a wholly unique story with character art in under a week. A favourite interest of mine is bushido, the code of samurai whose principles are still being practiced today for a better holistic and well-strategised life.

Due to the time-limit and personal inexperience with coding, the breadth of the project became too ambitious so I had to switch to a vertical scrolling website in order to meet the due date. 

#### Day 3 & Day 4
Started from scratch with the bushido theme intact, knowing that with my time has been cut in half this website was going to be front-end heavy - a great constraint for meto work with so I could practice client-side methods. A rapid search for libraries and manipulating css was implemented in the project with a late addition of using API's to utilize some of my learnings throughout my coding course.

### Aftermath
In retrospect, an app would've been more feasible to accomplish in the required time.
With the theme of Eastern Philosophy my future aim is to create a CRUD app where users can contribute to the website by posting blogs and recommending a slice of wisdom for people who come to visit the site.

## Cool Tech
### Libraries Researched
#### Parallax Libraries
~~stellar.js~~
~~skrollr.js~~
~~basicScroll.js~~
##### Final Choice
*[Rellax.js](https://dixonandmoe.com/rellax/)*
A lightweight, vanilla javascript parallax library.

#### Carousel Libraries
~~slick.js~~
*[flickity.js]*(https://flickity.metafizzy.co/)
Touch, responsive, flickable carousels library.

~scrollFade.js~
*[smooth-scroll.js]*(https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll)
A lightweight script to animate scrolling to anchor links.

*[aos.js]*(https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)
Animate On Scroll library using CSS3.

*[sakura.js]*(https://github.com/almightynay/jQuery-Sakura)
Uses CSS3 animations and requestAnimationFrame to put a plethora of cherry blossom petals that drift and sway in the "wind" on websites.

*[zlFetch]*(https://github.com/zellwk/zl-fetch)
A library that abstracts away the `handleResponse` function so you can skip ahead to and handle both your data and errors without worrying about the response.

zlFetch includes helpers for creating your request:
* Query parameters
* Authorization
* Converts body to JSON if you're sending JSON data


#### API's
1. The Movie DataBase - Acquiring film and tv data.
2. Google Books - Acquiring book data.

## Obstacles
1. Making the initial idea work in horizontal parallax functionality.
2. Finding the right library to work with.
3. Putting asynchronicity principles to work with the various libraries.
4. Changing ideas mid-week and having the remainding days to work on the final outcome.

## Further Objectives
1. Make the website as a functional CRUD app.
2. Replace stock images with original artworks.
3. Add an overflowing scrolling div in each tenet page.
4. Have more interactivity in the Media section.
5. Users should click on a media image and more information comes up.
