                <p>About Bushido</p>

                <p>Bushido was the code for Japan's warrior classes from perhaps as early as the 8th century through modern times. The word "bushido" comes from the Japanese roots "bushi" meaning "warrior," and "do" meaning "path" or "way." Literally, then, it can be translated as the "way of the warrior." 
                    Bushido was the code of conduct followed by Japan's samurai warriors and their precursors in feudal Japan, as well as much of central and east Asia. The principles of bushido emphasized honor, courage, frugality, skill in the martial arts, and loyalty to a warrior's master (daimyo) above all else. It is somewhat similar to the ideas of chivalry that knights followed in feudal Europe, and has just about as many bits of folklore—such as the 47 Ronin of Japanese legend—that exemplify bushido as the European counterparts do of their knights.

                <h1>Rectitude</h1>
                <div class="speech-text">
                    <p class="first">Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.</p>
                    <p class="second">Rectitude is one’s power to decide upon a course of conduct in accordance with reason, without wavering; to die when to die is right, to strike when to strike is right.</p>
                    <p class="third">Rectitude is the bone that gives firmness and stature. Without bones the head cannot rest on top of the spine, nor hands move nor feet stand. So without Rectitude neither talent nor learning can make the human frame into a samurai.</p>

                <div class="speech-text">
                    <p class="first">Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely, fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong.</p>
                    <p class="second">Courage is worthy of being counted among virtues only if it’s exercised in the cause of Righteousness and Rectitude.</p>
                    <p class="third">Perceiving what is right and doing it not reveals a lack of Courage. Courage is doing what is right.</p>

                <div class="speech-text">
                    <p class="first">Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have compassion.</p>
                    <p class="second">They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one.</p>
                    <p class="third">Love, magnanimity, affection for others, sympathy and pity, are traits of Benevolence, the highest attribute of the human soul.</p>

                    <p class="second">Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times.</p>
                    <p class="third">Politeness should be the expression of a benevolent regard for the feelings of others; it’s a poor virtue if it’s motivated only by a fear of offending good taste. In its highest form Politeness approaches love.</p>

                    <p class="third">True samurai, according to author Nitobe, disdained money, believing that “men must grudge money, for riches hinder wisdom.” Thus children of high-ranking samurai were raised to believe that talking about money showed poor taste, and that ignorance of the value of different coins showed good breeding.</p>

                    <p class="second">The sense of Honor, a vivid consciousness of personal dignity and worth, characterized the samurai. He was born and bred to value the duties and privileges of his profession. </p>
                    <p class="third">Fear of disgrace hung like a sword over the head of every samurai. To take offense at slight provocation was ridiculed as ‘short-tempered'. </p>

                    <p class="first">Bushido teaches that men should behave according to an absolute moral standard, one that transcends logic. What’s right is right, and what’s wrong is wrong.</p>
                    <p class="second">The difference between good and bad and between right and wrong are givens, not arguments subject to discussion or justification, and a man should know the difference. Finally, it is a man’s obligation to teach his children moral standards through the model of his own behavior.</p>
                    <p class="third">The first objective of samurai education was to build up Character. The subtler faculties of prudence, intelligence, and dialectics were less important. Intellectual superiority was esteemed, but a samurai was essentially a man of action.</p>
